Unfortunately not a lot is known about this board from Lomas. It's a SCSI controller with two serial ports and an RTC.
Schematics are not known to exist, and I have not been able to locate a manual anywhere. The onboard ROM has been 
archived, but it contains a PAL which is more difficult to de-logic without a schematic.

The repository contains a PDF of a schematic that I drew based on ohming-out the board. It is not complete, so it
should not be treated as canonical. I believe the SCSI part to be correct and complete, but I would need to 
go over it thoroughly again before I have confidence in its completeness.
