# LomasBoards
Small repository of files/data related to Lomas Data Products S-100 boards. I have
a particular interest in the Color Magic video board as it seems to have been
supported by the Seattle Gazelle that I own. The board of course is pretty rare,
so I'm redrawing it in KiCAD 6 to hopefully reproduce the board.

## Status
As of now, the schematics are entered, but I need a high-quality scan of the
board so I can get the chips positioned correctly. After that, I would need
dumps of the character ROM in addition to the few GALs that are used.
